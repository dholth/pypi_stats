Collect data about pypi's hosted packages in a sqlite database, including
parsing requirements from .egg-info/requires.txt.

Designed to be run against a local mirror of pypi.

Usage::

	# extract all interesting metadata from sdists in a directory
    python -m pypi_stats.count_easy_install /.../web/packages/source/

	# parse some of that metadata
    python -m pypi_stats.parse_pkg_info

The program produces a sqlite database called packagedata.db in the current
directory.
